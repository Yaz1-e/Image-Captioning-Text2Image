# Image-Captioning-Text2Image
This project allows users to either upload an image and receive an auto-generated caption with speech output (Image Captioning), or input a text description to generate an image (Text-to-Image). The project leverages advanced machine learning models such as BLIP for image captioning and Stable Diffusion for generating images from text.
